## Dataset Description

The `instacart` dataset contains 1384617 observations of individual
products from different instacart orders. There are 15 total variables
in this dataset describing order information, product information, and
customer information, which are listed below. For example, in
observation row 1027, the customer ordered concentrated homestyle
chicken stock which we can also see they have never ordered before
because of the value of 0 in the `reordered` column. We also know this
item was found in the canned goods department in aisle 69. One could
keep reading the values in the different columns for more information on
this product.

-   `order_id`: order identifier
-   `product_id`: product identifier
-   `add_to_cart_order`: order in which each product was added to cart
-   `reordered`: 1 if this product has been ordered by this user in the
    past, 0 otherwise
-   `user_id`: customer identifier
-   `eval_set`: which evaluation set this order belongs in
-   `order_number`: the order sequence number for this user (1=first,
    n=nth)
-   `order_dow`: the day of the week on which the order was placed
-   `order_hour_of_day`: the hour of the day on which the order was
    placed
-   `days_since_prior_order`: days since the last order, capped at 30,
    NA if order_number=1
-   `product_name`: name of the product
-   `aisle_id`: aisle identifier
-   `department_id`: department identifier
-   `aisle`: the name of the aisle
-   `department`: the name of the department

## Questions

### How many aisles are there and which aisles are the most items ordered from?

``` r
distinct_aisle_df = instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle, aisle_id) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  summarize(
    n_obs = n()
  )
```

There are 134 aisles, of which `aisle_id` 83 and 24 (fresh vegetables
and fresh fruits respectively) are the most ordered from. They both have
over 150,000 orders each.

### Plot of number of items ordered in each aisle

``` r
grouped = instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(aisle_count = n()) %>% 
  filter(aisle_count > 10000)

  ggplot(grouped, aes(x = (reorder(aisle, aisle_count)), y = aisle_count)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
      labs(
    x = "Aisle",
    y = "Number of Items Purchased",
    title = "Barplot of the most popular Instacart aisles") + 
    viridis::scale_color_viridis(
    name = "Aisle", 
    discrete = TRUE) + 
    coord_flip()
```

\### Table for three most popular items in each of the aisles “baking
ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”

``` r
three_aisles = instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>% 
  summarize(aisle_count = n()) %>% 
  filter(aisle == "baking ingredients" | aisle == "dog food care" | aisle == "packaged vegetables fruits") %>% 
  arrange(desc(aisle_count)) %>% 
  slice(1:3)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'aisle'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
three_aisles
